	unit_description= _ "There is an old tale about the creation of the the IceWind order: A gang of children were fishing when a very young female, hooking something bigger then she could land, was dragged into the subzero waters. She did not reappear. Two days later, by which time the tribe had nearly forgotton the loss, a sentry witnessed an unnerving spectacle. The very same girl, delirious with exhaustion and deathly pale, was spotted dragging herself from the pond.
After the incident the girl, whose name is a closely guarded secret, was never the same. The tribespeople told stories of seeing her freeze a bear solid, simply by looking at it, others claimed that she went out by night to converse with unseen things that moved in the water. Nobody dared approch her about these rumours, lest they prove to be true. 
She became the founder of the IceWind order, every year she would select children from the tribe to train. Whatever she taught them, it granted them a mysterious influence over the elements of their habitat. The Herders themselves describe this influence as 'union'. Within her lifetime the order became an accepted part of the clan. 
The child refused outright to reveal what had happened in the frozen pool and when she died many years later the secret died with her."+{SPECIAL_NOTES}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_MAGICAL}
