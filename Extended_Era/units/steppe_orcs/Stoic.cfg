Time and again a foe has struck down a Stoic and thought him dead, only to see the hardy orc lift himself from among the corpses of the dead, raise his shield and reasume his position.

Special Notes: Due to their lack of weaponry Stoic may not attack the enemy. When attacked however, they retaliate with heavy strikes with the front of their shields. "
